## 🏴‍☠️ CTF Pwn Solutions & Exploits

Hi there! 👋 I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast who just really enjoys **binary exploitation (Pwn)**.

In this repository, I archive the **exploit scripts (EXPs)** I've written for Pwn challenges from various CTFs.

Inside each challenge directory, you'll find:
* **The original challenge binary**
* **My exploit script**

## 🔍 Where Are the Detailed Writeups?

Exploit code alone doesn't always tell the whole story.

That's why I publish my **detailed analysis, vulnerability breakdowns, and complete walkthroughs** over on my personal blog.

I split the code and the analysis on purpose:

* To keep this **GitHub repo** as a clean **code archive**, making it easy to find and test exploits.
* To use my **blog** as the platform for **in-depth analysis**, documenting the full technical details and my thought process.

## 🗺️ How to Find a Writeup

It's simple:

Just browse the folders above, click on a challenge you're interested in, and open the `README.md` file. Inside, you'll find:
1.  Some quick info about the challenge.
2.  A direct link to the **complete writeup** on my blog.
